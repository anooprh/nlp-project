\documentclass[dvips,12pt]{article}

% Any percent sign marks a comment to the end of the line

% Every latex document starts with a documentclass declaration like this
% The option dvips allows for graphics, 12pt is the font size, and article
%   is the style

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{url}

% These are additional packages for "pdflatex", graphics, and to include
% hyperlinks inside a document.

\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{0.25in}
\setlength{\textwidth}{6.5in}
\setlength{\topmargin}{0in}
\setlength{\textheight}{8.5in}

% These force using more of the margins that is the default style

\begin{document}

% Everything after this becomes content
% Replace the text between curly brackets with your own

\title{A Template for Your Project Proposal}
\author{Your group members names here}
\date{\today}

% You can leave out "date" and it will be added automatically for today
% You can change the "\today" date to any text you like


\maketitle

% This command causes the title to be created in the document

\section{Introduction}

% An article style is separated into sections and subsections with 
%   markup such as this.  Use \section*{Principles} for unnumbered sections.
\section{Plan and Milestone}
Since in this project, we try to apply \emph{Deep Learning to Keyword Extraction}, we divide the project into the following small tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Be familiar with previous related works.
    \item Learn \emph{Deep Learning} method and how it can be used in NLP related applications.
    \item Design and do experiment and try to improve the model.
    \item Analyze the result and write the final report.
\end{enumerate}
For the midterm report, we need to finish the first two tasks, and implement some previous proposed methods and test them on the dataset.
\section{Goal}
We need to apply \emph{Deep Learning} to the problem and do the experiment on it. If the result is worse than the previous works, \textbf{at least} we need to figure the reason why it doesn't work and how to improve it. \\
For the ultimate goal, we need to improve the model itself and try to do keywords generating itself and in the end convert it to a unsupervised tasks.s
